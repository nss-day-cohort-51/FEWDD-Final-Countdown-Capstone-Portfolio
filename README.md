# FEWDD Final Capstone and Portfolio
Both are required for graduation.

The final capstone is similar in technical requirements as the front-end capstone and will include user specifications and a case study.

### Timeline
* 1/19 - üëç Initial Ideas
* 1/20 begin üë• user research
* 1/28 üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚ÄçüíªMust be coding
* 2/9 üõë Stop coding! üóÑÔ∏è Push working versions to GitHub. Update üåê website.
* 2/10 Afternoon Showoff ü§û
* 2/11 ‚è∞ Morning DEMO and üéì Graduation
## User Requirements
  * **Challenge Statement**. What problem are you solving?
  * Employ interviews and research to identify Users/Customers and create the deliverable **Personas**.
  * **Research and Illustrations**. This could include: competitive analysis, site audit, white papers, interview quotes, journey maps, observation photos, card sorting, or even post-it note walls.
  * **Client Goals and/or Constraints**. How will you achieve the goals and deal with the constraints? Time can be a constraint since you have only two weeks to build.
  * **Wireframes** - test with users.
    * *If necessary include an application flow diagram.
  * **Prototypes** - Use a prototyping tool and demonstrate your ability to mock-up an application.
  * How will you measure success? (user testing, survey, etc.)
  * **Case Study** - put it all together and tell a story.
    * Include lessons learned
    * Include next steps

## Technical Requirements
  * Defined MVP
    * Outline the features
    * Specifications
    * Functionality
  * List any API's you will be using (an API is not necessary).
  * Define Stretch Goals
    * List individual features
  * ERD - approval required prior to code
    * Instance of related data
  * ReactJS
  * Github repo with complete ReadME.md

### Keep in MIND
  * CRUD is an `easy` way to approval.
  * Use JSON server and host with heroku for a live demo.
  * Your idea may be bigger than MVP - that's ok.

## Portfolio Checklist

1. **Portfolio** - may also include case study with challenge statement, research/competitive analysis, persona, wireframes, mockups, user testing/feedback, conclusion.
  * Introduction. A summary to introduce yourself and your work-style to the viewer.
  * Project Case Studies (minimum 3 including front-end capstone and final capstone). This is the heart of your portfolio. It‚Äôs where you put the projects that you are proud of and want interviewers and clients to ooh-and-ah over.
  * Work History. An online version of your resume.
  * Contact: Make sure it is easy to get in touch with you and all links work to your website, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
2. **Front-End Capstone and Case Study** - challenge statement, persona, user testing(in current state), and conclusion/summary of findings. You should also include technologies used.
1. **Cohort Website and Case Study** - challenge statement, research/competitive analysis, persona, wireframes, mockups, user testing/feedback, conclusion.
1. **Other Projects** emphasizing technology and/or user goals.
1. **Backend Capstone and Case Study** - challenge statement, research/competitive analyst, persona, wireframes, mockups/prototype, user testing/feedback, conclusion. You should also include technologies used.

## Case Study Checklist
Compose a story to walk your viewer through the key points of the project. The project may be an entirely new app from idea to release, or it may be just a usability test or the mock-ups for a redesign. Every case study does not have to include all user 'scenario options'; every case study needs to demonstrate the best of your skills and the process you used.

* Project Overview. This short paragraph is meant to engage your viewer, to make them want to continue.

* Link to video if available

* Link to live site/app (if available), URL or links to App Store and/or Google Play.

* Your Role on Team. What did you do? You can wear many hats ‚Äì UX Researcher, Information Architect, Team Lead, Developer, etc. [Simon Pan](http://simonpan.com/) is very good about this.

* Challenge Statement. What problem are you solving? A good hiring manager will look to see if your design solved this problem or is just a collection of pretty deliverables.

* Users and Customers (Personas). This is the person you are designing the site/app for. Tell the story of how the product works from the user's point of view. Include points about why your design and development decisions meet user's needs. This is the perfect place to include your client-ready version of the Persona, but you can also include sketches if it helps tell the story of your process.

* Research and Illustrations: Include insights from any research that helps tell the story and supports your decisions. Some examples are competitive analysis, site audit, white papers, interview quotes, journey maps, observation photos, post-it note walls. Illustrations that demonstrate your process are helpful. Don't go overboard. Too much of a good thing is just too much.

* Client Goals & Constraints. Was the client losing customers? Introducing a new feature? Time, money, technology, the board of directors, dates - there is ALWAYS some kind of constraint you must workaround. Explain how you helped achieve the goals and how you dealt with the constraints. For example, a constraint might be the system is built in an archaic database and the client cannot currently afford to make a change. Part of your solution could be a warning message to the user that "This report will take 5 minutes to run. Would you like us to email a link to you when it's ready?"

* Wireframes & Prototypes. Show the process from sketch to final ‚Äî the final 'thing' may not be an app or site, that's OK. You are just talking about your place, role, and contributions. Don't include ALL of your sketches and screen mock-ups ‚Äî just the key ones to tell the story otherwise, your case study will be too long.

* Code & Data. What did you use to build the app? Include references to technology (React, react-router, SASS, JSON-server, responsive, etc.) Explain the process and include sketches or notes that illustrate your logic and decisions. Talk about how you interacted with other team members or back-end team if applicable. If the code-base was predetermined (as in that's what they're product is built-in), it gives you a chance to explain how your development designs work well with their existing code-base. Include any APIs or data sets you worked with.

* Lessons Learned. What would you do differently? What did you learn from interviews and usability tests that had a big impact on your final solution? Demonstrate how you applied the lessons to the project.
